# Challenge Help 1: If you choose to take on the challenge, you'll need to add `criterion` as a
# development dependency. Here is one way to do it:

[dev-dependencies]
criterion = { version = "0.5.1", features = ["html_reports"] }

# Challenge Help 2: Each benchmark needs a `[[bench]]` section with a name and disabling the harness.
# A name "somename" will correspond with a file "benches/somename.rs"

[[bench]]
name = "sploosh_speed"
harness = false

# Challenge Help 3: The Criterion documentation has a great tutorial for how to actually write your
# benchmark.  Don't skip the part about `black_box()`!
